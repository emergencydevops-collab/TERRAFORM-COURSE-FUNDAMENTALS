# Terraform Command Basics

## Overview

This project demonstrates the basic Terraform commands required to manage an AWS EC2 instance using Infrastructure as Code (IaC). It covers initializing Terraform, validating the configuration, planning changes, applying the infrastructure, and finally destroying it.

## Step-01: Introduction

In this tutorial, we will cover the following essential Terraform commands:
- `terraform init`: Initializes the working directory containing Terraform configuration files.
- `terraform validate`: Validates the configuration to ensure the syntax is correct.
- `terraform plan`: Previews the changes Terraform will make to the infrastructure.
- `terraform apply`: Creates or updates the resources defined in the configuration.
- `terraform destroy`: Destroys the resources managed by Terraform.

## Step-02: Pre-requisites

### Pre-Conditions:
1. Ensure the default VPC is present in the AWS region you plan to use.
2. Ensure the AMI ID (`ami-04d29b6f966df1537`) used in the configuration exists in the selected AWS region. Update it if necessary.
3. Verify your AWS credentials are correctly configured in `$HOME/.aws/credentials`.

### Example Terraform Configuration
The `main.tf` file includes the necessary provider settings and the resource block for an AWS EC2 instance:

```hcl
# Terraform Settings Block
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
    }
  }
}

# Provider Block
provider "aws" {
  profile = "default"
  region  = "us-east-1"
}

# Resource Block
resource "aws_instance" "ec2demo" {
  ami           = "ami-04d29b6f966df1537" # Update if necessary
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

## Step-03: Running Terraform Commands

Once your `main.tf` file is ready, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize Terraform**:  
   This command prepares the working directory by downloading the necessary provider plugins.
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Validate Configuration**:  
   Ensure your Terraform configuration is syntactically correct.
   ```bash
   terraform validate
   ```

3. **Plan the Infrastructure**:  
   Terraform will display the actions it will take to reach the desired infrastructure state.
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

4. **Apply the Configuration**:  
   Execute the plan to provision the EC2 instance.
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

## Step-04: Verify EC2 Instance in AWS

Once the instance is created, verify it in the AWS Management Console:

- Navigate to **AWS Console -> Services -> EC2**.
- Confirm that the new EC2 instance has been successfully launched.

## Step-05: Destroy Infrastructure

To clean up and remove the EC2 instance:

1. **Destroy the Instance**:
   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

2. **Clean up Terraform Files**:  
   Remove all Terraform-related files such as `.terraform`, `terraform.tfstate`, etc.
   ```bash
   rm -rf .terraform*
   rm -rf terraform.tfstate*
   ```

## Step-06: Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned the following basic Terraform commands:
- `terraform init`
- `terraform validate`
- `terraform plan`
- `terraform apply`
- `terraform destroy`

These commands are essential for managing infrastructure as code using Terraform.
```

This `README.md` provides clear instructions for setting up and managing the EC2 instance with Terraform while ensuring that users understand each step in the process.
